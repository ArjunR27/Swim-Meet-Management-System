# Psych-Heat-Sheet-Project
Creating a psych sheet and heat sheet for swim competitions given event entries. 

A psych sheet is a type of ordering for swimmers based upon their entry time for a specific event. The ordering ranks the swimmers from fastest to slowest within each specific event

A heat sheet is a type of ordering for swimming competitions. The heat sheet places sets of 8 swimmers in a 'heat', this heat then places each swimmer in a specific lane based upon their timing and ranking. For example, the fastest swimmer will be placed in Lane 4, second fastest will be placed in Lane 5, etc. This specific ordering is 4, 5, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 8 (4 being the fastest, 8 being the slowest).
